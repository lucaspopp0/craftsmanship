# channels
This assignment was an exercise in error handling. 
We were instructed to create an application which, given a set of instructions from a certain "channel" as an input stream, could decide using simple rules whether or not it was safe to connect to that channel.
The goal was to make the program as robust as possible without sacrificing reliability.
