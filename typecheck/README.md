# typecheck
A type synthesis package written in partnership with _Arik Stewart_ (ams382@case.edu). Allows the user to input types and rules for synthesis, then enter an expression with variables and types to see what type it evaluates to.

The assignment was an exercise in class design, unit testing, and error handling. 
* The [/test](https://github.com/lucaspopp0/craftsmanship/tree/master/typecheck/test/edu/cwru/ams382lmp122/typecheck) directory holds all our test cases with 100% branch and code coverage. 
* The [/architecture](https://github.com/lucaspopp0/craftsmanship/tree/master/typecheck/architecture) directory describes our class design
* Our approach to error handling is detailed throughout the code

**The Parser class is the entry point for the code**
